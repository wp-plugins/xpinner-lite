The xPinner Lite WordPress plugin is intended to automatically pin images to Pinterest.com

== Description ==

Key features

* The xPinner Lite plugin works absolutely automatically and does not require any manual input. It does not matter how exactly your post was added - manually or it was created by a content automation script like [CyberSyn](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cybersyn/ "CyberSyn").
* The plugin is able to automatically extract a first, last or a random image from a regular post/page body, WordPress galleries, NextGEN galleries, post thumbnail or a custom field with a given name and automatically pin it!
* The xPinner Lite plugin will pin images not only from the new posts, but from old ones too!
* You can limit the oldness of posts that can be processed by xPinner Lite.
* You can set the frequencies of pins to avoid your account suspension for a too frequent pinning.
